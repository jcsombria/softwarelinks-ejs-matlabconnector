    <p>
      The external application elements can be used to manipulate an engineering software from the EJS application. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The model element uses a communication protocol that mainly allows to:
    <ul>
      <li>Set the value of a variable located at the engineering software</li>
      <li>Get the value of a variable located at the engineering software</li>
      <li>Execute code directly in the engineering software</li>
    </ul>            
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: Check that the environment variable $Path of your system includes the path to Sysquake core(e.g. C:\Archivos de programa\SysquakePro) 
    </p>


    <h3>Levels of the communication protocol</h3>
      Users can manipulate the engineering software using two levels of the comunication protocol:
    <ul>
      <li>Low-level protocol</li>
      <li>High-level protocol</li>
    </ul>            
    Usually, the high level protocol is all that most users will need to fulfill their interaction
    requirements, it being therefore the recommended entry level for users who
    are not expert programmers or do not need a very detailed control of the communication.
    The low level protocol is the preferred choice for users that need full control of the communication
    mechanism. Needless to say, a correct use of the low level protocol to design
    an interactive simulation requires some more programming effort than that of the high
    level protocol. But it should also be noted that it can also result in a more efficient final
    application (in terms of communication traffic and execution times).    

    <h3>Remote communication</h3>
       This external application model element does not support remote communication with Sysquake.       

    <h3>Usage</h3>
       The dialog of this model element is divided in the following two sections:

      <p><b>Table of Linked Variables</b></p>
       The use of this sections enables the high-level protocol. 
       The table allows to link Sysquake variables with EJS variables, in such a way that any change in a variable is updated in the other one after a call to the <b>step</b> method.
       The variables can be written directly in the corresponding column of the table.
       A right-click on a row lunch a pop-up menu that allows to </b>connect</b> or select an EJS variable to be linked. The pop-up menu can be also used to <b>insert</b> or <b>delete</b> a row. 

      <p><b>Advanced Options</b></p>
      The two checkboxs of this section are used to:         
        <ul>
          <li>Start automatically the connection with the engineering software, otherwise the connection is started by using the <b>connect</b> method</li>
          <li>Wait forever the existence of a variable when its value is required from EJS, otherwise the existence of the variable is tested only ten times</li>
        </ul>  
    
    <h3>Example of a low-level protocol</h3>
     With the configuration by default of this element (i.e., local mode, low-level protocol and advanced options checked), put the following code in an evolution page of your simulation.        
    <br> 
    <pre>
     t=t+0.1;
     sysquake.setValue("tt",t);
     sysquake.eval("yy=sin(2*pi*0.5*tt)");
     y=sysquake.getDouble("yy");
     System.out.println("y="+y+" at t="+t);
    </pre>
    Create the variables <b>t</b> and <b>y</b> in the Variables section of your simulation, and execute the simulation. In the console of EJS a message is shown.         

    <h3>Example of a high-level protocol</h3>
    Use the previous example, but now modifying the Table of Linked Variables of the model element. In the table put two rows wih the variables <b>tt</b> and <b>t</b>, and <b>yy</b> and <b>y</b> as Sysquake and EJS variables respectively.
        Modify the previous code of the evolution page by the following:
    <br>                 
    <pre>
     t=t+0.1;
     sysquake.step(1);
     System.out.println("y="+y+" at t="+t);
    </pre>
    Create an initialization page with the following code:
    <br> 
    <pre>
    sysquake.setCommand("yy=sin(2*pi*0.5*tt)");
    </pre>
    Similar as previous example, the console shows the same message when the simulation is run.
